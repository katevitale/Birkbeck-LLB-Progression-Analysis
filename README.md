Code written by KV in 2019

All .ipynb scripts import a custom package of functions called 'LLB_custom_scripts.py' (pc) or "LLB_custom_scripts_mac.py" (mac). 

"Anonymize student data.ipynb" is run by a user at Birkbeck to anonymize student module grades data, which can then be sent to KV for further processing.

"Create summary modules.ipynb" is run by KV with anonymized data, and produces an excel file with summary statistics that allow easier visualization of trends.
